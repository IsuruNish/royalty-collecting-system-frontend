# WHY IS **OSCA**?
<p align=justify>They don’t have a system for their members to get ideas about the transparency of royalties. OSCA members have zero motivation when getting a membership and updating their change song ownerships. OSCA Officials have to spend more time when getting information for the licenses.</p>

<p align=justify><strong>Our project is to automate the OSCA's manual system</strong>. By making this system, we are expecting to solve all the above-mentioned problems using the automated system. After implementing this system, OSCA members can see their monthly and annual income and which songs they got royalty with full transparency. Apply licenses process would be automated with easy-going for both OSCA Officials and show organizers. For the first time, all the members will register their songs in the system up to date. </p>

## WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
---
In OSCA, there are four main users for this system.
- Admin (Director)
- OSCA Officials (other staff)
- Members (registered artists)
- Show Organizers (the person who does concerts)

So,
- We are providing a platform for show organizers, artists, and OSCA.
 <br/>

As well as following things also will be included in the system.
- The mobile application will be developed only for members.
- Login and authentication module
- Online payment module - when the applying licenses
- Report generate module - to generate reports for Admin, OSCA Officials, Member and, Show Organizers about their monthly/annual payments/incomes
- SMS module - sending verification code when forgetting passwords
- Database - Admin, OSCA official, member, show organizer, licenses (applied/ approved/ rejected), registered songs details
 
<br/>
<br/>
